                <h2> About </h2>
                <p> I graduate (3.98 GPA, Summa Cum Laude) with a major in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis </p>
                <p> I specialize in cloud and backend work. I love writing RESTful APIs and CLIs especially in Go(lang) or Python. </p>
                <p> I am also very comfortable with Java (it was the first language I learned) as well as Javascript/Typescript and C/C++. </p>
                <p> While backend and cloud development is preferred, I can create simple UIs using many modern frontend technologies including Swift, JS/TS, Angular, and React. </p>
                <p> Outside of course-work and work-work, I enjoy developing personal projects to practice both design and implementation in many languages. </p>
                <p> Note that nearly all of the projects on this account are personal projects. I do not usually post coursework or group work unless I get approval from my professors so the integrity of the course is maintained or the entire group agrees on ownership and roles during development. If you would like to see any of these projects, ranging from CS theory of all disciplines to implementations of full stack applications, feel free to reach out and I can give you access. </p>
